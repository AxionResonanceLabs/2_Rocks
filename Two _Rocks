# Two Rocks

Two identical stones.  
One in the left hand.  
One in the right hand.

Move the right stone to the left hand.

**Before:** `(1, 1)`  
**After:** `(2, 0)`

The total is conserved:  
`1 + 1 = 2 + 0`

If this operation is fundamental, it must have one rule to avoid chaos.

The rule is:

```

C(r) = 0.001 × (1 + 2r) × e^{-r/3} × e^{i × (π/4) × r}

```

Where `r` measures the separation between operations.

From this rule, it follows necessarily that:

- The optimal connection occurs at **r = 2.5**
- The quantum amplification factor is **402**

Everything else in the physical universe is a consequence of these numbers and this rule repeating.

That is all.
